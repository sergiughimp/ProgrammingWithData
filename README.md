Task 1: Reads the imdb_tv_250.csv file, extracts title, year, and rating for each TV show, and stores them in a list of lists called movies_lst.
Task 2: Converts movies_lst into a list of tuples (movies_tpl) for better memory efficiency and data safety because tuples are immutable.
Task 3: Defines a show_info(rank) function that prints information about a show based on its rank, including validation for invalid ranks.
Task 4: Sorts all shows by year and prints the 10 oldest TV shows from the dataset.
Task 5: Counts and prints how many TV shows have titles with more than 3 words. Result: 43 shows.
Task 6: Uses Matplotlib to create a bar chart showing the number of TV shows released each year.
Task 7: Prepares a histogram to visualize the distribution of TV show ratings.
